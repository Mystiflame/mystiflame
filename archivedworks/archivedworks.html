            <h2>Tale of the Two Sisters</h2>
            <p>Karisuma and Loranne both enrolled in the same temple and were educated thoroughly about the world and magic. Karisuma seemed to pick up how to use her magic quite efficiently and easily graduated without stress. However, Loranne did not have a good grasp on how to use her magic so her magic was weak; undeveloped. Inexperienced, she graduated after Karisuma (3 years younger than her) and was the laughing topic for a whole month due to her overwhelming hotheadedness during her time in the temple.</p>
<p>The two sisters reunited a few weeks after Loranne had graduated, setting off in a journey together to live with one another- to pass the 10-year "Development Test" as the Gods would call it. They met countless new faces along the way which helped them. Loranne's magic improved somewhat, but it was still below average.</p>
<p>On their 6th year of the journey, they stumbled upon an abandoned temple. The reason for abandonment was unclear to everyone around the area at that time; there were many theories that tried to explain what had happened. Some people say that a student in the temple had caused a great magical outburst, demolishing the place and themselves along with it- binding them to the area. Others say that an earthquake had shaken the temple into an irreparable state, killing all within and binding them. What is known, for sure, is that many students died trying to learn there.</p>
<p>Loranne thought it was a good idea to explore the place and did so, despite Karisuma's protests. Karisuma eventually gave in and explored with her to defend against any potential threat. Eventually, they would find active teleportation runes in a dusty room. After inspecting the runes for a few minutes, the sisters agreed not to touch it or the portal being made by it. However, as they were preparing to leave, darkness filled the room and blocked the only exit available. It was clear something sinister was at work- perhaps the sisters had disturbed the fallen, or another evil entity was making itself known. The sisters quickly switched their game plan, resolving to using the portal made by the teleportation runes, mistaking it for a simple travel-warp. They had not learned about teleportation runes. It would not be their fault for not knowing that they were getting teleportation off-planet, to another one: [REDACTED].</p>
<p>*The sisters were born in one of the wealthier cities of Coruscare, but they had to at leave it at 5 years old and never saw it again.</p>
<p>*Those who knew Karisuma and Loranne while they were travelling had no idea where they went, and so gave up on trying to find them.</p>

                <h2>Soul of a Dying Will: CHAPTER ONE</h2>
                <p>Laughter filled the soundless area around the two. It was coming from the younger one, a girl with green hair and yellow eyes, wearing a green jacket. There were 9 belts all over her, all unconnected for some reason. Said girl was holding a rather strange looking blade, 6 different colored crystaled encased within the sword. The reddest of the crystals appeared to be glowing, radiating what looked like a very murderous aura around the girl. The other woman, having the same colored hair but red eyes, and different clothing, worriedly looked at the young one. She held up a massive great sword, as if she were ready to cut down the younger one. But something looked off. The older one looked ready to collapse, and the younger one looked ready to end the world, having not a single dent on her body.</p>
                <p>The older one spoke, with a shaky voice, “Aileen, can't you get some sense and notice who you're fighting?!" The younger one, who's name is Aileen, did not listen. She only thought of ending this poor woman’s life and moving on to a city, to destroy it. Wordlessly, she dashed at the older one, ready to cut her down, when a bullet flew through her arm. Aileen grunted and looked up, giving the older one an advantage. She quickly grabbed Aileen in a headlock, jabbing a syringe into her arm. In Aileen’s vision, it slowly started to blur...then it became darkness.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the assist, Melinda,” said the older woman. She was talking to a redhead girl with blue eyes. “No problem, Ashlyn! By the way, you’re pretty beat,” said Melinda, observing Ashlyn's condition. The area they were in...was once a city, filled with individuals. Now it's been reduced to a wasteland of rubble and dead corpses laying on the ground, giving a heavy sense of loneliness and emptiness.</p>

                      <h2>Soul of a Dying Will: CERTE ANTE CATACLYSMIC</h2>
	<p>Day after day, night after night, teachers are always hard at work in the educational buildings of Marigold, a giant city that may seem like it could cover a good chunk of Lapis, which was the world, however, in reality, it only covered a mere dot’s size on the world map. In Marigold stands a wide and tall school named “Community Starter School of Marigold”, commonly shortened to “CSSM”.</p> <p>Over 100 teachers work in this school, but there was one teacher in particular who wasn’t always a hardworking person. His name was Norm, a gymnastics teacher...and an alcoholic.</p>
	<p>The digital clock on the wall of Norm’s office struck 5:00 PM. It wouldn’t be long before the brilliant crimson sky of Lapis turns into a gloomy dark void. Schooling hours ended 3 hours ago, so now, all that was left was to do some paperwork. However, Norm didn’t really care for that. To him, it was boring, doing paperwork. So he did the next best thing on his mind, which was drinking alcohol. Norm reached for one of the 5 filled-to-the-brim bottles of alcohol on the table he was sitting at, only to have another person’s hand stick out in front of it, restricting Norm’s access. He looked up with an angry expression on his face at the newcomer, before sighing and realizing who it was.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s just you, Kate...” mumbled Norm with a monotone voice. Kate stared at him for a moment.<p>
<p>“What? ‘S there something on my face?” Norm questioned. Kate facepalmed.</p>
<p>“No, Norm. You’ve been drinking for quite a while now. It’s only been three hours, and you’ve already drunk 5 mugs of coffee along with 2 full alcohol bottles! Not only that, but you’ve only written the word ‘the’ on your paper this entire time.” Kate said, confident that this’ll get through Norm’s head. Norm rolled his eyes, hoping that the scolding from his wife wouldn’t last for an hour.</p>
<p>“What will the others think? Norm, I'm starting to get really worried..!” Kate said, her expression changing to one of concern midway through her sentence.</p>
<p>“I don’t really care for what the others think,” Norm nonchalantly said, “as long as I get my pay, everything’s going to be fine!” After finishing, he slaps away Kate’s hand and grabbed an alcohol bottle, eagerly popping the top off to have a quick chug. Kate crossed her arms and looked down, thinking. Norm smashed the alcohol bottle onto the table he was sitting in front of, almost cracking it.</p>
<p>“Now that’s the good stuff! This beats everything!” Norm said, raising his fist into the air.</p>
<p>Kate looked back up, a face filled with sadness, a floodgate about to burst open. She paused for a moment.</p>
<p>“Even me?”</p>
<p>Norm got up, a puzzled expression on his face. His eyes were swirling.
“Hmm? Oh, of course I’d- hyuk- do that again!”</p>
<p>It was already done. Norm became drunk faster than a snap. Of course, this was normal, as hybrids, which were a ‘synthetic species’ created by the Lapian Government using the properties of a humanoid and an animal, could get drunk faster than a normal humanoid since alcohol’s effects were amplified by 10%, which included every single type of hybrid in Lapis. Norm happened to be one of them.</p>
<p>Kate left the office without saying anything. She turned and walked out of the building, seeing as the exit was infront of her as she left Norm’s office. Now this was also common, as Norm had been drinking for quite a while, meaning Kate had to repeat the same movement route every time Norm got drunk. This was something none of her kids had to see, but thankfully, they were safe in their parents’ house. Kate sighed, walking away from the building which was surrounded by grassland and roads. On Lapis, there weren’t any cars or buses, so Kate just walked and walked. One’s feet would get tired of a 1-Mile walk to a house, but not her.</p>
	<p>As Kate left the building, there opened an ocean of possibilities for Norm, now that she was gone. That annoying voice telling him what to do and what not to do was finally gone. Norm felt like he had woken from a terrible nightmare.</p>
	<p>“And now- hyuk- I’ll put on an act...just for you guys!” Norm told the air. He seemed to be hallucinating, seeing a cramped but excited crowd of imaginary fans in his office. The size of the office was unusually big, considering it’s a teacher’s office, designed to fit in 100 people at best. The drunk hybrid began to flail his arms around as a means to please the imaginary crowd in front of him, which was, to anyone’s surprise, working quite nicely. Norm then tripped over a chair, making it fall over with a thud. He got up, seemingly unphased.</p>
	<p>Norm grabbed another bottle of alcohol, chugging it entirely, before violently smashing the bottle onto the floor.
	“Oh yeah- hyuk- why am I- hyuk- even here in the first place? I- hyuk- should be havin’ some fun!” And so the man left his office, which became a horrid mess of papers and chairs thrown on the floor.</p>
	<p>Norm’s first target was the floor he was on; the basement. There weren't many classrooms here, but even they had to feel Norm’s drunken wrath. Room B-1, a science class which housed a polite and caring teacher by the name of Sunny. As she was enjoying her silent, peaceful, and calm time, Norm barged into the room yelling like a monkey.
	“The school’s on fire! Run! Run- hyuk- kids! The school’s on fire, and you’re all gonna- hyuk- die!” Norm yelled, startling Sunny in the corner of the room.</p>
	<p>“Run! I said run! Listen to me! Hyuk- listen!” He said, while slowly disorganizing the room by bumping into chairs, tipping them over, and actually flipping tables for no apparent reason. Sunny just stared at the freakshow in front of her eyes. This was truly a sight to behold.</p>
	<p>The hybrid then stopped and looked directly at Sunny, who wasn’t saying anything but was visibly shaking.
	“You...You gotta get outta here- hyuk- Sunny! The school’s on fire…!” Norm lied.</p>
	<p>Sunny shook, unable to speak.</p>
	<p>Norm laughed, flopping his arms onto the table in front of Sunny and dragging them across it, pushing everything off of the table. Norm then ran out of the classroom, laughing like a maniac.</p>
	<p>His next stop was the second floor. He thought it was best to save the best for last, which was the first floor. Norm ran up the stairs, encountering a few trips along the way which knocked him hard on the head. The first thing he saw was Room C-2, an art room. In it had another female teacher who was also polite and sometimes laid back in her classes, and she went by the name “Kat”. She had been drawing pictures in her free time, already done with 10 of them. Suddenly, the door to the classroom was kicked open by Norm, which sent high speed winds onto Kat’s table, flinging all of her drawings out the open window. It even started raining shortly afterwards too, likely destroying the drawings in the process.</p>
<p>“You- hyuk- like jazz?” Norm seductively said, putting a shaky hand on the table, staring at Kat. Said woman had a horrified expression.</p>
<p>“Answer- hyuk- the question, you good-for-nothing oaf!” Norm yelled. Now Kat was sweating. Didn’t know what to say, didn’t know what to do. This called for the best tactical option available, which was do nothing.</p>
<p>“Fine then- hyuk- have it your way!” Norm said, as he walked over to a chair and picked it up. He turned to Kat, ready to throw the chair. Kat got under her table quickly, barely avoiding a steel chair that knocked against the wall. Norm yelled at a high volume, beginning to convert the room into what would soon look like a mini landfill. Kat was hiding during all of this, even tearing up because now, her glorious drawings were gone.</p>
	<p>The drunk man trashed the room for what seemed like half an hour, and finally left. Kat put both of her hands on her face in sadness.</p>
	<p>“What did I do to deserve this..?” Kat questioned.</p>
	<p>Norm set course for his last target, the first floor. It contained the main office, which had the principal in it. His mind told him that the principal absolutely needed to see a grand finale act from him. He ran down the stairs with the face of a kid receiving a talent show award. The man finally stopped in front of the door to the office. It was there. It was waiting for him. The doorknob was pulling Norm’s hand to it. It must be turned. Norm instead rammed into the door like a bull.</p>
  <p>“This is it, this is the grand finale! Are you ready- hyuk- kids?!” Norm screamed, making the principal behind the counter spill their coffee. The principal, whose name was “Pop”, became angered.</p>
	<p>“Norm! Get back to your office, now! I’ll fire you, if you don’t-,” Pop got interrupted by Norm shoving 3 lollipops into his mouth.</p>
	<p>“Cool down- hyuk- everything’s going to be fine! Now- hyuk- watch my little performance!” said Norm, who then proceeded to pull out a strange and round object from his pocket. Pop squinted, then quickly realized what it was. A mini bomb, designed to set off a chain reaction of explosions if it were to go off near anything electric or flammable.</p>
	<p>“Norm...Norm, don’t do it, I’ll actually fire you if you set that off!” Pop warned. The warning passed over Norm’s head, as Norm had already set up the bomb near an electric box on the wall. Pop tried to run to the fire alarm on the other wall, but slipped on the spilled coffee, hitting his head on the ground pretty hard. It knocked him out, meaning now Norm could finish his “grand finale”.’</p>
	<p>“Fireworks! Hyuk- fireworks for all to see! It’s an Earth holiday- hyuk- which means it’s time for fireworks!” Norm hollered. He set the bomb to explode after 3 minutes. This was a terrible situation, as most of the teachers in the school at the time weren’t aware of Norm being drunk on that day, so they had no warning that the school’s electricity-powered machinery would blow up in 3 minutes. Norm ran out of the office, and out of the school through the double doors that were next to the entrance of the office. He was 100 feet away from the school, until he suddenly dropped onto the ground, passing out. The effects of alcohol had worn off, but what he did earlier was something that cannot simply be undone.</p>
  <br>
	<p>Kate knocked on the door to a house surrounded by trees and plants. The house was away from the city of Magnolia, exactly one mile away from the school. Kate and Norm lived here, but their kids also lived here as well, however, they were usually left alone if both parents were out to do something. The door opened, someone in pajamas greeting Kate.</p>
	<p>“Hi mom! Where’s dad, is he still doing school stuff?” the girl at the door said.</p>
	<p>“He’s doing that, yeah…” Kate replied, a hint of sadness in her voice. She looked down, walking into the house. The girl, who was assumingly the daughter of Kate, wondered why her mother wasn’t energetic as always today. Then out of nowhere, a large noise was heard, followed by thousands of people screaming in the distance. Kate stopped and turned, running outside of the house. Her daughter also ran out, along with another girl who was the daughter’s sister. The three ran all the way back to Magnolia, stopping to look at what happened. A scary scene was waiting for them, a few feet away.</p>
	<p>The school was destroyed. All of it was reduced to ashes. Anyone who was in it had died due to the explosion, the indication being ash covered corpses of women and men found in the rubble.</p>
	<p>“Oh...oh dear. What happened..?!” Kate shrieked, starting to panic. Mumbling noises of a distressed person were coming from a few feet away from Kate, which the kids ran to.</p>
	<p>“Dad! Dad! Are you okay? Are you hurt? What happened?” the kids rapidly questioned. Norm, who was the distressed person, stared at the ruins laid before him. He was shaking, sweating, and questioning himself. This was all his fault. His actions led to the deaths of well over 100 men and women. He looked at Kate from far away, then behind her. The city protection forces had arrived at the scene, walking towards Norm.</p>
	<p>“We’re going to have to ask you to come with us, sir.” one of the officers said. Norm followed them without question, still looking at Kate and his kids on the way.
Kate and her kids looked back at Norm with a disgusted look on their faces.</p>
	<p>The officers and Norm sat at a table in a dimly-lit room. Norm started to regret everything. He went as far as to regretting his existence.</p>
	<p>“Now, sir, we’re going to ask you some questions,” said the officer at the other end of the table, hands folded together. “And we expect that you answer with complete honesty. Is that understood?”</p>
	<p>Norm took a while to nod once.</p>
	<p>“First question. We know that you’ve been here before, and that was because you broke several display cases in a phone store. Those actions were caused by the effects of alcohol, was it not?”</p>
	<p>Norm was silent.</p>
	<p>“Was this incident also caused by those same effects as well?”</p>
	<p>Norm looked to the side, refusing to respond. A taser was shoved onto his face, activating and shocking him. He yelled in pain.</p>
	<p>“I’ll ask again,” said the officer, this time with a more serious tone of voice. “Was this incident caused by the effects of alcohol?”</p>
	<p>The tasing stopped, and Norm furiously nodded yes. Drinking alcohol was the only thing he could remember before suddenly waking up to find a giant pile of ash.</p>
	<p>“Second question. You have a family, right?” the officer asked.
	Norm immediately looked up, slamming the table with his arms.</p>
	<p>“What do you want with them?! I’ll kill you if you do anything to them!” he yelled, angry. Another officer tased Norm a second time.</p>
	<p>“I only asked if you had a family. Now, here are your choices. You can either be put to death, rebuild the Community Starter School of Marigold with a few others, have your wife be put to death, have your kids be put to death, or be tortured for a month straight.” the officer said, listing off all of the choices Norm could go with. He growled, then smiled.</p>
	<p>“Torture me.”</p>
  <p>The officers looked confused.</p>
  <p>“Come again?” one of them said.</p>
  <p>“I said torture me. I don’t care what happens to me anymore, as long as my family’s not involved. I also wouldn’t like having the citizens involved as well.” he said with a grin. The officers looked at eachother, then grabbed Norm.</p>
  <p>“You asked for it, sir. We’ll take you to the torture chamber, however, be warned. You cannot go back on this choice.” the officer warned.</p>
  <p>Norm shrugged, still grinning. The officers dragged him out of the room. The one sitting at the end of the table mumbled.</p>
  <p>“It’d be best to have him stay away from his family as well…” He looked at another officer.</p>
  <p>“This is an order. After Norm’s release, do not let him near his family at all costs. Understood?”</p>
  <p>The officer saluted, walking out of the room afterwards. As he did so, the officer sitting at the table slowly smiled.</p>
  <p>A month had passed. The school that had blown up was rebuilt without Norm’s help. Norm himself was nowhere to be found in Marigold. Kate and her kids were back at their house, doing nothing. If only Norm were there, they’d be having laughs, cracking jokes, and overall being entertained. However, after the explosion occured a month ago, that wouldn’t be possible anymore. This was probably for the better, as Norm would be considered a criminal from now on. If he was gone, everyone was happy except for 3 people. If he was still present in the city or near it, he’d be fighting a war that couldn’t possibly be won against angered citizens.</p>
  <p>This...was probably for the better.</p>

                          <h2>The Ceremony of Innocence: FULL STORY</h2>
      <p class="storychap">PROLOGUE</p>
      <p>There was not a single soul that heard of it. Not even my siblings. I had to let them know. I had to let all of them know. But he wouldn't let me. All to preserve his own image. I've always hated that part of him. He only cares about himself. Narcissistic prick.</p>
      <p>That's when I realized I wouldn't get any support when it was time to be thrown out. All of his friends would turn their backs on me, as if I never set foot in the house at all. In all honesty, it could've been worse with them. I've seen their looks. I've heard of their stunts. Maybe the outside world was more acceptant of me.</p>
      <p>That was a yes and no situation for me.</p>

      <p class="storychap">CHAPTER 1</p>
      <p>“You are never to set foot near this damn house, you hear me?!” an enraged man roared. That man happened to be my father. All noise in the room was being directed towards me- not a pleasant experience to my eardrums or mentality. He's never been like this to me- at least, not when I'm there. Today was different though. Nobody made themselves known to be in the house, so it had only been me and Father. The perfect opportunity to let loose, he might've thought.</p>
      <p>I stood in front of him, staring at the carpeted floor for what seemed like half an hour. It'd gotten tainted with my tears. That was the least of my worries, however. My father was more focused on exploding for the reason that I didn't live up to his grand expectations. I did have a choice. I could’ve. But I didn’t.</p>
      <p>Father's train - level roaring dies down, degrading into a frustrated medium-level tone. “Do you hear me boy? Never again. You'd better hope somebody out there finds your presence somewhat comforting, boy. You bring shame to me and my name. You are no longer considered a Fomalhaut,”</p>
      <p>I felt my hair being violently pulled. The floor looked like it was sinking before my eyes.</p>
      <p>“-and so you can,”</p>
      <p>In seconds, I was dragged to the main entrance of the house.</p>
      <p>“-go to,”</p>
      <p>Father kicked the door open, sending ripples of air throughout the room. My face was bombarded with the foreign winds of the outside.</p>
      <p>“-hell!”</p>
      <p>I couldn't remember anything but a sharp pain in my back after that. Ten minutes passed, and all I did was lay down on the soft green grass in front of the house for the very last time of my life. Pondering.</p>
      <p>I didn't ask for this life.</p>

      <p class="storychap">CHAPTER 2</p>
      <p>“You're filth in my eyes,”  his words echoed.</p>
      <p>The grass was getting uncomfortably cold- it was night time. It's only a matter of time before Father figures out I've been sitting in front of his house for well over half an hour. There was a risk of dying right here right now, but I didn't want to take that. It was time to leave.</p>
      <p>Shaking off the dirt from my back after managing to stand up, some lights in the distance captured my attention. My family lives on a hill, far from our city. Only “important” people were allowed to set foot on the hill. Father made that clear with an always-active Plasma Singe barrier at the foot of the hill. Anyone who was a trespasser could be set aflame the moment they step through the somewhat transparent blockade.</p>
      <p>The hill itself is surprisingly easy to navigate up and down on. If you were going up, there were specially crafted iron - reinforced dirt steps leading up. If you were going down, you could just as easily use the dirt stairs- or just slide down the soft grass using a board of sorts. The latter worked out perfectly for me, as I arrived in front of the barrier, unscathed. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the best experience of my life that night.</p>
      <p>Now that I'd disconnected from the house exterior grounds, the were-distant-lights became slightly closer. They were beautiful lights, as if they were dabs of bright color on a black canvas. A truly fascinating sight.</p>
      <p>This was new to me though. I was in the house for most of my life. There wasn't a single period of time where I was allowed outside the house itself. Something about “triggers” in the hill. None of that mattered now- my mind was more focused on taking in the sight before my eyes. I wanted a closer look. A sharper image. No longer am I associated with Father. This was my ticket out. Finally.</p>
      <p>I let loose the last breath of an only child ever to be contained in the barrier and walked through the Plasma Singe gate. I kept walking, eager to visit the source of the lights.</p>
      <p>As I looked back, I swore that I saw a fizzing image and the absence of the hill and gate.</p>

      <p class="storychap">CHAPTER 3</p>
      <p>"Kill yourself."</p>
      <p>There was a large iron gate. Closed, and most likely locked. I'd spent about 10 minutes to get here, only to find that. It won't stop me though- not now at least. Nothing can.
      I softly knocked on the gate. My knuckles instantly froze. Maybe I shouldn't knock on a giant iron gate that sits outside the city… it's no wonder why it's cold. Better find an alternate, and quick, I thought. I needed to be sneaky now.</p>
      <p>Circling around the city perimeter, I noticed that there weren't any cracks in the walls. Not even a dent. It looked like I had to wait a full night for the gate to open now, but that thought quickly escaped my mind as I make a sudden discovery. There was a hole in the ground, directly pressed against the bottom of the wall. Could that be it? Could that be my convenient way into the city? Only one way to find out.</p>
      <p>With some difficulty, I slid into the hole without thinking it might lead me somewhere else. I found myself sliding down the thin crevice a little farther than I expected. Then it became alarming. I couldn't see the exit anymore. I couldn't stop sliding down- the dirt had become like pudding, and as such I couldn't climb up anymore. I didn't bother screaming for help, because I knew nobody would come save me. This wasn't the secret path into the city.</p>
      <p>I finally stopped sliding and started falling. All I saw was a black void. My body felt light as I started to float in mid air. White, glowing specks of light flew in the distance. I didn't know what any of it meant- other than it was pretty. The specks of light disappeared after a few moments as a large white silhouette that looked like a door appeared in front of me for a second.</p>
